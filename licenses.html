granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date

that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
such warranty or additional liability.</p>
